====================================

This is a set of examples to walkthrough the use of cucumber-jvm step-by-step using Eclipse IDE.

* access-control-1 - Write requirements as acceptance tests expressed using the gherkin language (with Given, When Then - GWT) in English and Chinese. 
* access-control-2 - Create empty step-definitions that will implement the acceptance tests. 
* access-control-3 - Fill step-definitions with skeleton code generated by cucumber-jvm.
* access-control-4 - Write skeleton API for source code based on requirements.
* access-control-5 - Write test code in step-definitions to invoke the source code API.
* access-control-6 - Implement source code API to pass first step of acceptance test.
* access-control-7 - Implement source code API to pass second step of acceptance test.
* access-control-8 - Implement source code API to pass third and fourth step of acceptance test.
* access-control-9 - Refactor source code to improve logical separation
