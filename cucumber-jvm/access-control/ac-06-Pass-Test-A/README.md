access-control-6
================

This is the sixth part of the access-control cucumber-jvm example series.

# src - implement the source API to pass acceptance tests.
* IUserDataAccess.java - Add user data access. 
For simplicity, we use a memory based mechanism. 
Essentially a HashMap to hold UserAccount objects.
